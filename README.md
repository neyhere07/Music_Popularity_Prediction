# Music Popularity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves building machine learning models to estimate the popularity of tracks based on their audio features. Accurately predicting music popularity can assist streaming platforms in better understanding user preferences, optimizing playlists, and enhancing recommendation systems, ultimately boosting user engagement and satisfaction.

### Overview: 

Music popularity prediction means using regression techniques to forecast the popularity of songs based on various music features and metadata. Expected results include accurate predictions of a song’s future performance in terms of streams, downloads, and chart positions, which enable music producers, artists, and marketers to make informed decisions.

### Problem Statement:

- Predict the popularity of music tracks based on their audio features, such as energy, valence, danceability, loudness, and acousticness.
- Assist music streaming platforms in improving user engagement by accurately estimating track popularity, which can optimize playlists and enhance recommendation systems.
- Identify the key audio features that most strongly influence a track's popularity and build a predictive model that can generalize well to unseen data.
- Use machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning to develop the most accurate predictor, measuring success through metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R² score.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships and ensure proper data preprocessing for model input.
